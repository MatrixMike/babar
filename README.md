A Programming Language with Speech Acts inspired by
[Elephant 2000](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/elephant/elephant.html).
The parser uses the wonderful Clojure
[Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse) library.
The language goals are to explore some concepts of speech acts. To
support this goal, there is some syntatic sugar to make the language
more readable as sentances. The main manifestation is that parens
are optional.

This language is a playground, so don't expect things to
be stable or documentation up to date.


## Data Types
Most of the data types are directly from Clojure.  You have integers,
decimals, strings, booleans, keywords, maps, and vectors,

```clojure
1     ;=> 1
2.3   ;=> 2.3
-3.4  ;=> 3.4
"cat" ;=> cat
:bird ;=> bird
true  ;=> true
{:cat :meow :dog :bark} ;=> {:cat :meow :dog :bark}
[1 2 true :bird] ;=> [1 2 true bird]
```
Vectors are a bit interesting in the respect that you don't need
to input the square brackets.  If you just put in space delimited
items, it will automatically constuct a vector for you.

```clojure
1 2 3 4 => [1 2 3 4]
```

If you want to nest the vectors, you need to include the square
brackets.

```clojure
1 2 [3 4 5] ;=> [1 2 [3 4 5]]
```

## Operations
The basic usual suspects are supported : ( +, -, / , *).
The interesing thing to note is that parens are optional,
and all operations work on a vector by default - so:

```clojure
(+ 1 2 3 4 5) ;=> 15
```
Is the same as:

````clojure
+ 1 2 3 4 5 ;=> 15
````

## Commands
A subset of the clojure commands have been included. This will
grow in time.  Mind you parens are optional.  You can call functions
with the typical () or with a shorthand : syntax

- def (def identifier expression)
```clojure
  (def dog 16)
  dog ;=> 16
  
  def cat 18
  cat ;=> 18
```
- defn (defn identifier params expression)
```clojure
  (defn cat [x] (+ x 2))
  (cat 2); => 4
  
  defn dog [] "woof"
  dog: ;=> "woof"
```
- if  (if predicate truecase falsecase)
```clojure
  if true :cat :dog ;=> :cat
```
- =, <, >
```clojure
  = :dog :dog ;=> true
  ```
- and  (and val1 val2 & others)
```clojure
  and true true true ;=> true
  and true true false ;=> false
```
- or  (or val1 val2 & others)
```clojure
  or true false true ;=> true
  or false false false ;=> false
```
- import
There is basic support for importing clojure namespaces.
At this basic level it imports the whole namespace and does require
:refer :all
```clojure
  import "clojure.java.io"
  parse file
```

### Anonymous Functions
You can create anonymous functions with the fn [x] syntax from
clojure. And call them with surrounding parens.
````clojure
   ((fn [x] + x 1) 3) ;=> 4
   ((fn [x y z] + x y z) [1 2 3]) ;=> 6
   ((fn [] [4 5 6])) ;=> [4 5 6]
```
